# CPU Chart Widget

### Installing
This project includes submodules. Prior to building, run `git submodule update --init` from the git root directory.
It expects to find `libsys-monitor.so` lib in `3rdparty/sys-monitor/build/` but you can change it in `cpu-chart.pro` file
(in the **LIBS** section).

Made exclusively for training purposes. If you have any suggestions, code comments or willing to make it more
sophisticated - I will gladly accept your help.
